1st February 2024
________________________________________

Intro:
In this lab i demonstrated a vulnerability assessment where i manage the contents of a security analysis overview of a company that needed a vulnerability assessment to see what their weaknesses are. The documentation listed in this repository show the steps taken to go against this issue. 


Scenario:

You are a newly hired cyber security analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cyber-security professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.
A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
